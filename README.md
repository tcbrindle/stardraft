# StarDraft: StarCraft Map Visualization

    Draft: definition - "A preliminary sketch, outline, or version"

***StarDraft*** is a small, efficient C++ library intended to make the following tasks as simple, fast, and enjoyable as possible:
* Visualizing existing Starcraft maps with a fluid, intuitive interface
* Testing and comparing map analysis / path-finding software in real-time
* Real-time editing of maps for debugging and testing of algorithms
* Implementing video-game related assignments / projects for programming classes

This project provides the following features for accomplishing this task:
* An SFML-based GUI for panning, zooming, and interacting with maps
* An intuitive ASCII-based map format that is easily human readable in any text editor
* An easy to use open source framework for implementing your own map analysis / vis tools
